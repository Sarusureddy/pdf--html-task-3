        <h2 style="<b>;font-size: 25px;font-family:sans-serif; margin-left: 20px;">Knowledge Management</h2>
         <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">KM has been loosely defined as a collection of organizational practices related to
generating, capturing, storing, disseminating, and applying knowledge (MacMorrow,
2001; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995). It is strongly related to information technology,
organizational learning, intellectual capital, adaptive change, identification of information needs, development of information products, and decision support (Choo, 1998;
Fouche, 1999). They are so intimately related, in fact, that it is often difficult to say where
one approach stops and another begins. We will primarily view KM as a system for
processing information. This is certainly the organizing thrust of the CIS. The CIS obtains
the knowledge it translates to the public from the NCI (Figure 1). It is organized to provide
consistent, quality information translated in a manner that can result in meaningful
responses on the part of callers (e.g., course of treatment) that transforms basic
information into knowledge (and perhaps in some cases even into wisdom and ultimately
action). Thus, the KM service the CIS provides makes information purposeful and
relevant to individuals that need it, who are often in dire circumstances.
Knowledge itself runs the gamut from data, to information, to wisdom, with a variety of
distinctions made in the literature between these terms (e.g., Boahene & Ditsa, 2003).
Special weight in the context of the CIS is given to a consensus surrounding refereed
scientific findings that can be translated to the public to improve cancer prevention,
detection, and treatment. What is knowledge is often a matter of intense negotiation
between various stakeholders as evidenced by the recent controversy over the most
appropriate ages for screening mammography (HHS, 2002). Accordingly, the KM
structure of the CIS is fundamentally a responsive one, very dependent on changes in
the larger biomedical environment. It does not have the luxury of operating in a command
environment, it must respond to the diversity, complexity, and sense-making abilities
(health literacy) of its audience, placing it clearly in more post modern conceptions of KM
(Dervin, 1998). So, the CIS must respond to the information environment of an information
seeking public, with information specialists acting as the public’s human interface in
             transforming information to knowledg</p>

                and Clinical Practice</h2>
        </center>
        <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px;margin-left: 20px;">Information seekers are often frustrated in their attempts to seek information, especially
from doctors in clinical settings. A major focus of health communication in recent years
has been on the long-standing problems with patient-doctor communication (Thompson, 2003). The amount of information physicians give to patients is correlated with
            patient satisfaction with healthcare and with compliance (Street, 1990). People are more</p>
        
        <img src="image%201.jpg">
        <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">likely to follow behavioral recommendations when their understanding is high. Lack of
communication between doctor and patient has been found to relate to decreased ability
to recall information given by the caregiver, patient dissatisfaction, decreased adherence
to prescribed regimens, and other forms of non-compliance (Brown, Stewart, & Ryan,
            2003).</p>
         <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">Cancer-related information seeking is often a great challenge to individuals. They have
to overcome their tendency to deny the possibility of bad news and the distasteful
problems associated with cancer. They also have to be willing to believe that their
individual actions can make a difference, that by seeking information they gain some
control and mastery over their problems. They also have to overcome the limits of their
education and prior experience. They have to possess skills as information seekers, An
awareness of databases, familiarity with the Internet, an ability to weigh conflicting
sources of information and to make judgments about their credibility. In short, any one
of the factors in this long-linked chain could severely impede, if not halt, the information
seeking process. Recognizing this, individuals are increasingly relying on knowledge
brokers, such as the CIS, as intermediaries to conduct their searches for them (Johnson,
             1997).</p>
         <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">There are a number of ways that use of knowledge brokers can complement clinical
practice. First, individuals who want to be fully prepared before they visit the doctor often
consult the Internet (Fox & Rainie, 2002; Taylor & Leitman, 2002). Indeed, Lowrey and
Anderson (2002) suggest prior web use impacts respondent’s perception of physicians.
Second, there appears to be an interesting split among Internet users, with as many as
60 percent of users reporting that while they look for information, they only rely on it if
their doctors tell them to (Taylor & Leitman, 2002). While the Internet makes a wealth of
information available for particular purposes, it is often difficult for the novitiate to weigh
the credibility of the information, a critical service that a knowledge broker, such as a
clinical professional, can provide. This suggests that a precursor to a better patientdoctor dialogue would be to increase the public’s knowledge base and to provide
alternative, but complementary information sources, by shaping client’s information
fields. By shaping and influencing the external sources a patient will consult both before
and after visits, clinical practices can at one in the same time reduce their own burden for
             explaining (or defending) their approach and increase the likelihood of client compliance.</p>
        <h2 style="<b>;font-size: 30px;font-family:sans-serif; margin-left: 20px;">Why is Cancer-Related Information Seeking Important?</h2>
         <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">Information is an important first step in health behavior change (Freimuth, Stein, & Kean,
1989). The consequents of information carrier exposure and seeking are many, including
information gain, affective support, emotional adjustment, social adjustment, attitude
change, knowledge change, behavior maintenance, a feeling of greater control over
events, reduction of uncertainty, and compliance with medical advice (Johnson, 1997).
Information seeking can be defined simply as the purposive acquisition of information
from selected information carriers. Cancer-related information seeking has become
increasingly important over the last decade. Not too long ago, information related to
cancer was the exclusive preserve of doctors and other health professionals. Today in
the U.S., not only is the diagnosis shared, but individuals have free access to an often
bewildering wealth of information. With this access has come an increasing shift of
responsibility (some might say burden) to the individual to convert information into
             knowledge, in the process making decisions concerning his/her treatment and adjustment to cancer (Johnson, Andrews, Case, & Allard, in press)</p>
        <h2 style="<b>;font-size: 30px;font-family:sans-serif; margin-left: 20px;">Individual Responsibility/Client/Consumer Movement</h2>
         <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">Increasingly the responsibility for health-related matters is passing to the individual,
partly because of legal decisions that have entitled patients to full information (Johnson,
1997). The consumer movement in health is in part actively encouraged by hospitals,
insurance providers, and employing organizations (Duncan, 1994) who want to encourage health consumers to ‘shop’ for the best product at the most affordable price (Hibbard
& Weeks, 1987). Facilitating and enhancing this consumer movement have been explosive developments in information technologies, which make more specialized media
sources available, permitting increased choice in information carriers, and increased
connectivity with other interested parties (Case, Johnson, Andrews, Allard, & Kelly,
             2004; Duncan, 1994).</p>
        <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">Large numbers of patients do not receive state of the art treatments (Freimuth et al., 1989),
partly because physicians cannot keep up with the information explosion (Duncan, 1994;
NCI, 2003). The overload of information on health professionals today forces decentralization of responsibilities, with increasing responsibility passing to individuals if they are
going to receive up-to-date treatment. The physician is no longer the exclusive source
of medical knowledge; they must be cognizant of the welter of information available and
their role in this complex system (Parrott, 2003). Recognition of the limits of health
professionals also requires individuals to be able to confirm and corroborate information
by using multiple sources. In fact, patients often call the CIS to verify information they
            receive elsewhere (Freimuth et al., 1989).</p>
         <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">Cancer patients tend to want much more information than healthcare providers can give
to them, even if willing (Johnson, 1997). Information that to a client is necessary for
coping with cancer, may be seen by doctors as an intrusion into their prerogatives.
Exacerbating this problem is the fact that doctors and patients may not share similar
             outcome goals. Traditionally, doctors have viewed the ideal patient as one who came to</p>
                 <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">them recognizing their authority and who were willing to comply totally (with enthusiasm) with recommended therapies (Hibbard & Weeks, 1987).
Perhaps the most threatening aspect of enhanced information seeking for health
professionals is their loss of control. Many doctors have legitimate concerns about selfdiagnosis and patients possessing just enough information to be dangerous (Broadway
& Christensen, 1993) and the general preferences of consumers may cause them to avoid
unpopular, albeit effective, invasive procedures (Greer, 1994). Still, the more control that
health professionals have, the less effective they may ultimately be, especially in terms
                     of insuring that clients act according to consensus views of treatment (Johnson, 1997).</p>

            <h2 style="<b>;font-size: 30px;font-family:sans-serif; margin-left: 20px;">Solutions and Recommendations</h2>
        </center>
         <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">One approach to managing these problems is for those in clinical practice to either create
or to partner with KM services that recognize the public’s demand for information and
the various difficulties involved in reaching the people who need information in the most
timely fashion. There are a number of indications that programmatically the best channels
for providing cancer-related knowledge are those channels that constitute a hybrid of
             the positive properties of both mediated and interpersonal channels.</p>
             <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">Information and referral centers can take many forms, such as hotlines, switchboards,
and units within organizations (e.g., nurse’s medical help lines) where individuals can
go to get answers to pressing concerns from knowledge brokers. They serve three
primary functions: educating and assisting people in making wise choices in sources and
topics for searches; making information acquisition less costly; and being adaptable to
a range of users (Doctor, 1992). These services have been found to offer considerable
                 help and assistance to callers (Marcus, Woodworth, & Strickland, 1993).</p>
             <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;"> Telephone information and referral services like the CIS represent a unique hybrid of
mediated and interpersonal channels, since they disseminate authoritative written
information, as well as verbal responses to personal queries (Freimuth et al., 1989). The
hybrid nature of telephone services is important, since it can overcome some of the
weaknesses of other channels. They have the additional advantage of homophily of
source, a crucial factor in effective communication (see Rogers, 2003), since the calls are
handled by individuals of closer status and background to potential callers than are
physicians. It has been suggested that the CIS provides an important link between
symptomatic people and health services, since a substantial proportion of callers follow
up with more information seeking, passing on information to others, or consultations
                 with health professionals (Altman, 1985).</p>
             <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">The advantages of telephone services as a channel include they: are free, are available
without appointment and forms, offer a high level of empathic understanding, offer
greater client control, permit anonymity for both parties, bridge geographic barriers,
provide immediate responses, the client can take greater risks in expressing feelings,
convenience, cost effectiveness, and personalized attention (Johnson, 1997). All these
factors are reflected in respondents rating CIS as the highest quality source of cancer
             information (Mettlin et al., 1980) and the extremely high rate of user satisfaction in</p>
        <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">subsequent surveys (Morra, Bettinghaus, Marcus, Mazan, Nealon, & Van Nevel, 1993;
            Thomson & Maat, 1998; Ward, Duffy, Sciandra, & Karlins, 1988).</p>

        <p style="font-style: italic;font-size: 20px;margin-left: 20px;">We need every weapon against cancer, and information can be a powerful,
lifesaving tool. ... A call is made, a question is answered. NCI reaches out
through the CIS, and the CIS is the voice of the NCI (Broder, 1993, pp. vii).</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;font-size: 20px;margin-left: 20px;">... one phone call, one conversation, can save a life. This is the true essence of
the service and the most rewarding aspect of the program (Morra, Van Nevel,
            O’D.Nealon, Mazan, & Thomsen, 1993, p. 7)</p>
         <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">In broad sweep (see Figure 1), the CIS has traditionally been the disseminator/translator
of consensus based scientific information from NCI to broader segments of the public,
responding to demand characteristics of an increasingly knowledgeable, responsible
public. We can easily organize a description of the CIS around the major functions of KM
organizations: transforming information into knowledge; identifying and verifying
knowledge, capture/securing knowledge; organizing knowledge; retrieving and applying knowledge, combining it, creating it, and finally distributing/selling it (Liebowitz,
             2000).</p>
        <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">The CIS is one section of the Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch
(HCIRB) of the Behavioral Research Program (BRP) of the Division of Cancer Control and
Population Services (DCCPS). The DCCPS is a major research division of NCI that also
has research programs focusing on Epidemiology and Genetics, Applied Research, and
Surveillance Research. The BRP contains additional branches relating to Applied Cancer
Screening, Basic BioBehavioral Research, Health Promotion, and Tobacco Control. (For
more information see http://dccps.nci.nih.gov). The “HCIRB seeks to advance communication and information science across the cancer continuum-prevention, detection,
            treatment, control, survivorship, and end of life” (http://dccps.nci.nih.gov/hcirb).</p>
        <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">The CIS was implemented in 1975 by the NCI to disseminate accurate, up-to-date
information about cancer to the American public, primarily by telephone (Ward et al.,
1988; Morra, Van Nevel et al., 1993) and is currently governed by the principles of
“responsiveness, tailoring information to audience needs, and proactively sharing
information” (http://cis.nci.nih.gov/about/orgprof.html). The CIS was one of the first
federally-funded health-related telephone information systems in the US (Marcus et al.,
            1993).</p>
        <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">Information is available, free of charge, in both English and Spanish to anyone who calls
1-800-4- CANCER. In recent years the CIS has added a special telephone service to
promotion smoking cessation (1-877-44U-QUIT), as well as services for the hearing
impaired, and has instituted a range of web-based services. The CIS responds to nearly
400,000 calls annually and many more requests for assistance on its LiveHelp website
            feature (http://cis.nci.nih.gov/about/underserved.html). In total, in 2002 the CIS handled</p>
